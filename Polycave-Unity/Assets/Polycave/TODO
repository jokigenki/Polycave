1 Intro
2 User is placed in Kanji room
3 They "play" a game (just a popup for now)
4 They can then move up, down or across (i.e. up to a compound, down to radicals)
5 This is done by choosing a rune from their bag (for now just buttons)
6 This makes the choices appear as bubbles
7 Selecting a bubble warps the user into that bubble, and the cycle repeats from 2.
8 The user can select a different rune to see a different choice, or cancel to remove all the choices.


We first display a multi layer text display, which is used for sentence, compound, kanji
We display 1 or 2 runes, up and down, sentences has only down, kanji has only up, compounds that have no kanji only have up
Clicking a rune:
Kanji: the display vanishes, and is replaced by bubbles containing all of the available compounds
Compound down: the display vanishes, and bubbles animate in for each of the kanji parts of the compound
Compound up: the display vanishes, and bubbles animate in for each available sentence
Sentence down: the display vanishes, and each compound in the sentence is replaced by a bubble

character distance is 0.15
