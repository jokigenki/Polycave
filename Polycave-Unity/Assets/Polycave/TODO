Data sets

Links between items
- Sentence -> Compound - Example sentences should be marked up with compounds so we know where they are. Take this list and check whether we have the compounds stored in data
- Compound -> Sentence - Each compound should be linked to a single sentences
- Compound -> Kanji - Search the kanji data set for the kanji in the compound (they should all be present)
- Kanji -> Compound - Search the compound data set for the kanji
- Kanji -> Radical - Each kanji should contain a list of the radicals it contains

1 Intro
2 User is placed in Kanji room
3 They "play" a game (just a popup for now)
4 They can then move up, down or across (i.e. up to a compound, down to radicals)
5 This is done by choosing a rune from their bag (for now just buttons)
6 This makes the choices appear as bubbles
7 Selecting a bubble warps the user into that bubble, and the cycle repeats from 2.
8 The user can select a different rune to see a different choice, or cancel to remove all the choices.
